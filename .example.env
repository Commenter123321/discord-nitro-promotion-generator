## The mode to use when getting the promotion codes.
## You can either use 'webdriver' which is not working right now,
## ... or you can use 'request' which is insanely fast and it's working.

## This cannot be an http proxy if you use 'webdriver' mode.
## Uncomment to enable.
# PROXY = "some://prox:y"
